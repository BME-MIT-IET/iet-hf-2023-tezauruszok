Manual test cases:
	Simple step and pick up test:
		arrangements:
			pick one player, hit Mentés button and then Játék kezdése button
		expected result:
			map is loaded which consists of squares with player's name on its head, with empty inventory
		result:
			as expected
		
		step1:
			click on the field next to the player
		expected result:
			the player steps on the chosen field
		result:
			as expected
		
		step2:
			click on the storage next to the player
		expected result:
			the player steps on the chosen storage amino acid and nucleotide counters are increased by 20
		result:
			as expected
		
		step3:
			click on the bunker next to the player
		expected result:
			the player steps on the chosen bunker the equipment on the field is displayed in the inventory
		result:
			inventory contains two instances of the equipment on the field
		
		step4:
			step down until the last bunker
		expected result:
			the inventory should only contain the first 3 equipment
		result:
			the inventory contains all kinds of equipment
		
		step5:
			click on the lab next to the player
		expected result:
			the player steps on the chosen lab a genetic code which was on the field is displayed in the inventory
		result:
			as expected
		
		step6:
			step up until the last lab
		expected result:
			game should be over, the virologist should win
		result:
			games goes on

	Sack and jacket effect test:
		arrangements:
			pick one player, hit Mentés button and then Játék kezdése button
		expected result:
			map is loaded which consists of squares with player's name on its head, with empty inventory
			
		step1:
			step onto a storage
		expected result:
			amino acid and nucleotide counters are increased by 20
		result:
			as expected
			
		step2:
			step onto the bunker with sack
		expected:
			inventory contains sack
		result:
			inventory contains two instances of sack
			
		step3:
			step onto a storage
		expected result:
			amino acid and nucleotide counters are increased by 21
		result:
			as expected
	
	Two virologists interactions test:
		arrangements:
			pick two players, hit Mentés button and then Játék kezdése button
		expected result:
			map is loaded which consists of squares with players' name on their head, with empty inventory
		result:
			as expected
			
		step1:
			step onto the other players field
		expected result:
			two players are on the same field one of them covers the other
		result:
			as expected
			
		step2:
			with player two step on a storage, with player one just wander on simple fields
		expected result:
			player two's amino acid and nucleotide counter increased by 20, nothing happens to player one
		result:
			as expected
			
		step3:
			with player two step on a lab, with player one just wander on simple fields
		expected result:
			player two's inventory displays the genetic code from the lab, nothing happens to player one
		result:
			as expected
		
		step4:
			create a virus with the known genetic code with player two
		expected result:
			player two's inventory displays the virus created from genetic code, player two's amino acid and nucleotide counter decreased by the cost of the virus
		result:
			the counter only decreased in the next step
		
		step5:
			step onto the same field with the two players
		expected result:
			two players are on the same field one of them covers the other
		result:
			as expected
			
		step6:
			use the virus with player two on player one
		expected result:
			player one's inventory displays the effect that the virus caused player two's inventory does not contain the used virus
		result:
			as expected
		
	Effects test:
		arrangements:
			pick two players, hit Mentés button and then Játék kezdése button
		expected result:
			map is loaded which consists of squares with players' name on their head, with empty inventory
		result:
			as expected
		
		step1:
			with player two step on a sack with player one wander on simple fields
		expected result:
			player two's inventory contains sack
		result:
			inventory contains two instances of sack
		
		step2:
			with player two step through every storage, with player one step on a storage
		expected result:
			player two's amino acid and nucleotide counter increased to 80 player one's amino acid and nucleotide counter increased by 20
		result:
			as expected
			
		step3:
			with player two step on second lab then step there with player one
		expected result:
			two players are on the same field one of them covers the other both inventories contain forget genetic code
		result:
			as expected
			
		step4:
			with player two create forget virus
		expected result:
			player two's inventory contains forget virus
		result:
			as expected
	
		step5:
			with player two spread forget virus onto player one
		expected result:
			player one's inventory does not contain any genetic code
		result:
			as expected
			
		step6:
			step down do the same with freeze virus
		expected result:
			player two's amino acid and nucleotide counter is increased by 20 player one's amino acid and nucleotide counter decreased by 20 and is frozen
		result:
			cannot create freeze virus only forget(first in the list of codes), counters does not modify and frozen player can step
		
		step7:
			step down do the same with crazy virus
		expected result:
			player one steps randomly
		result:
			cannot create crazy virus only forget(first in the list of codes), and player one does not step randomly
